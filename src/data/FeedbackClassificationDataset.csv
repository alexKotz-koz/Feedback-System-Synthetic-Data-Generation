1,Application Review,Zocdoc,SCAMMERS,,Vague,What about the application makes the user think it is a scam?,,,,,
2,Application Review,Zocdoc,"A waste of time and resources. Patient requesting 2-3 appointments, were billed for it. Then system is always having issues with itergration of our schedule and it takes forever to get anyone on phone to fix.",,Ambiguous,"User mentions patient requesting appointments, but does ont clairify how or why they were billed for the appointments. User also states application having issues with integrating their schedule into the application, but doesn't specify what issues they were having",,,,,
3,Application Review,Zocdoc,"I agree with the others. We have a 70% Zocdoc no show rate. Most users will not answer their phones, provide wrong phone numbers and wrong emails. Was spending upwards of $3500 monthly for just a few patients. Zocdoc refuses to make changes to their platform to force patients to put correct information on file before requesting a visit. I also believe that they have bots scheduling appointments as statistically it seems impossible that so many people don't know their own phone and email addresses and also would no show. I have a higher percentage show up from my own web scheduler and organic google leads. I have also attempted to remove them from my google listing as they do put a link on your account and charge you for it even though it is your SEO advertising that got them to your site.",,Clear,Several specific complaints about the platform. Explains why the complaints are frustrating and how they are impacting the users,,,,,
4,Application Review,Zocdoc,"They have reduced their customer service, and increased their prices. They charge for patients who do not show up or return any calls.",,Vague,"User presents three statements that are potential complaints. Reduced customer service, why is this important. Increased their prices, to what and is that a problem? Chareg for patients who do not show up or return calls, this is clear",,,,,
5,Application Review,Zocdoc,"Many no-shows and inaccurate patient profiles. Wouldn't recommend it because you still pay if the patient doesn't show. Like others, I'm suspicious that some bookings are fraudulent or made with ill intent.",,Clear,User states the product has inaccurate patient profiles. Clearly states why they do not recommend the application. Agrees with other comments and states why. ,,,,,
6,Application Review,Zocdoc,Zocdoc significantly increased the number of new patients we are seeing.,,Clear,States a positive outcome of using the application.,,,,,
7,Application Review,Zocdoc,"New practice, and started google ads with organic SEO options. I had some success and for shortcut tried zoc doc, which was a disaster. They scheme you to sign up with $40 per patient fee which you agree thinking even a patient comes you get $100 from insurance you at least get paid $60! Wrong. So they have either some bots or real people who will book your slots and wait 24-48hrs and then cancel their appointments. We try to call all zoc doc appointments right away as zoc doc have policy that if pt cancels (Not practice) within 24hrs then no charge. Of course you guessed it right, no one cancels within 24hrs and we are charged every time. I called and wrote to them and they say -these built into their pricing model which means we fooled you with $40/patient initial model. They even boast they have a very reputable study (mind you they stress on every time like robot that's it’s a very reputable study-maybe they have been told by their bosses who are really making fat check bonuses) and when I asked give me name of study or send me a copy to review there is no response! Now most of the cancellations are from SELF PAY patients. Now none of them will show up and even after me requesting Zoc Doc says they will not stop booking and charging me for self-pay or out of network patients as they want to give more options to these patients. I said why don't you make it free for self-pay patients on zoc doc, and they say of course not. So, one more nail in the coffin. I noticed the patients I had from google or from my website kept showing for scheduled appointment but the zoc doc ones 30% were either no show for second follow up appointment or won’t commit to come back after initial cough cold visit. One even told me that patient is going for annual exam after 3 days to her own PCP!! Vow that was shocking as I felt that I really do not have any long term relationship with these patients and I was accommodating these appointments skipping my lunch time. Zoc Doc went even one step ahead and put there booking link right on my google business listing so even if some patients want to go directly through my website they also go through zoc doc and they then won the patient and charge me $40 for serving me patient which i earned by google advertisement . Shameless and Shady! So those doctors who are still loyal to zoc doc please look on your GMB and other websites and remove zoc doc link as they are selling you back your own lunch. The most dishonest marketplace App I have associated with is zoc doc. Want proof please try yourself.",,Clear,Complaint about high price. Provides example of the application is a scam. Provides example of bad customer service. ,,,,,
8,Application Review,Zocdoc,"Zocdoc has become a scam under the new management and under new deceptive pricing policies. They bill you per referral and them pepper you with fake bookings strange since the new pricing policy a whole bunch of people book without insurance and then do not respond to practice phone calls and zocdoc doesn't do anything to resolve such fake bookings as it hurts their revenue, Through deceptive policies they have covered all their bases and made it impossible for the provider to resolve fraudulent bookings. PROVIDERS MUST STAY AWAY.",,Clear,"Bill per referral, fake bookings with no response or is a no show for their appointment. Hurts revenue stream. ",,,,,
9,Application Review,Zocdoc,They have become greedy by moving towards per patient appointment which increaes my cost by 200-300% then what I was paying as annual subscriber. Still with them but looking at options for better solutions that can drive me business without paying so much.,,Clear,Specific complaint about pricing.,,,,,
10,Application Review,Zocdoc,"If you are in NY, stay far away, actually run. Zocdoc is now charging $60 for every new patient. This is not legal in NY, and they will tell you it is. For a fraction of the money, promote your business on-line and direct patients to your web-site to make appointments.",,Clear,Specific complaint about pricing. States that the current pricing model is illegal in NY and suggests using a different product. ,,,,,
11,Application Review,Zocdoc,I’m happy with zocdoc. It’s the only marketing I have. I’m solo neurology. Zocdoc makes me very searchable. Many of my patients are self referred now from the internet. The scheduling integrates with Athena. I have used it since 2013. I looked into other marketing options and they were much more expensive. I hope there will not be a drastic change to their fee structure.,,Clear,Happy with the marketing strategy and outcome it has had. Address potential pricing concern.,,,,,
12,Application Review,Zocdoc,"Fairly expensive . Forces patients to sign up to a ""Zoc Doc account "" before they can book an appointment . The patients are then presented with variety of other providers and services. If that patient wants to come see you again on a given Monday and you are booked. Good luck. Zocdoc will happily help them book another doc down the lane. I was one of the early adopters (Signed up in 2008) . Have stopped placing them on website as a scheduling resource. I used Nextpatient (integrates with Athena) which doesn't have any of these tricks and your patients remain your patients .",,Clear,"Specific complaints: expensive, forces patients to signup before using the app. Recommends using Nextpaitent because of direct integration with EHR and doesn't play tricks (described earlier in comment)",,,,,
13,Application Review,Zocdoc,"We have used ZocDoc for 3 years. It takes a little to get everything just right but since we have we have had huge numbers of new patients. They range in age however with the number of young professionals moving into our area we find that this generation really likes the convenience of looking for a doctor and scheduling on-line.
",,Clear,"Positive comment, increased number of new patients, young professionals like the convencie of the app",,,,,
14,Application Review,Zocdoc,"We have been a long term user and have had a very positive experience until recently. Beware of ZocDoc going forward. They are radically changing their pricing model in some states which may be very negative for smaller practices. We have been a long term partner and generated hundreds of positive reviews with ZocDoc. We used their scheduling software in conjunction with Athena and generated many new patient visits as part of their subscription model ( which was reasonably priced). But now that is all changing. Starting in June 2018, they want to charge between $50-100 per new patient. This would raise our costs by literally 1000% a month! We find this new model only helpful to ZocDoc and could really hurt smaller practices like ours. We feel we are captured by their model right now. We would never have signed up with this pricing model in place. Buyer’s remorse.",,Clear,"Previously had a positive experience, but the chane in pricing has discouraged this user from using the product.",,,,,
15,Application Review,Zocdoc,"ZocDoc offers a great resource for online scheduling and web search exposure, especially for smaller practices who might not be as tech savvy or have access to often costly SEO options.",6,Ambiguous,How was the application advantagous for non-tech savvy users?,,,,,#DIV/0!
16,Application Review,Phreesia,I would like to show my appreciation for all the hard work your team did to help us get our new system working and with the continued support from the rest of the team to get everything working the way it should. Awesome job all!,,Vague,What did the team do for the user that makes them appriciate the work the company did for tem?,,,,,
17,Application Review,Phreesia,"I would give it a minus review but that rating is not available . We had a lot of grief with this platform with them being fully aware that this was one physician show from registration to check out - nothing got imported into Athena which wasn’t the impression these bloody liars gave. Anytime patient cancelled appointment in Phreesia , Athena had no notification which is a major flaw that they try to hide .  You have to log into multiple systems which is useless and on top of that they were super miserly and did not refund our money for system not working .",,Clear,"Company lied about integration with athena, problems with schduling and communction between app and EHR, explained burden with logging into multiple systems, did not refund money for system not working",,,,,
18,Application Review,Phreesia,"The onboarding process ups and downs were as expected. However, the detailed attention to any issues that occurred was pleasantly surprising! Ajith and Niku were extremely knowledgeable and friendly. There were quite a few adjustments to make, which is normal when implementing anything new to your practice. Once adjusting our staff and patients to the changes, we all agree that the changes were well worth it. It is saving time in all areas of our practice, which in the medical field is greatly appreciated!",,Vague,What issues were encountered and addressed? What adjustments had to be made? ,,,,,
19,Application Review,Phreesia,Great partner and always willing to help make our operations better. Our Client success advocate Aarti is amazing.  She ensures that problems are addressed timely and is makes suggestions to improve practice operations that are impactful.,,Vague,What specific problems did the representative help address? How did they make the users operations better?,,,,,
20,Application Review,Phreesia,"Being a rural Alaskan town, many of our residents are adverse to change, especially regarding technology and healthcare. But, implementing Phreesia into our system has gone over surprisingly well. The process has been effortless and relatively issue free. Whenever we encountered an issue, the implementation team was always quick to respond. They were always professional, friendly, and knowledgeable. Overall, we have had an amazing experience bringing on Phreesia.",,Vague,What specific interactions made the user have an overall positive experience with the company?,,,,,
21,Application Review,Phreesia,"Our company recently implemented Phreesia to streamline our pre-registration process. Best decision ever! Danish and Tejas, our implementation representatives, were exceptional.",,Vague,How did Phreesia help the customer streamline the pre-registration process. What made Danish and Tejas exception representatives?,,,,,
22,Application Review,Phreesia,"Working with our onboarding team of Shivangi and Ayan was such a positive experience. They were meticulous, timely and extremely attentive during what could have been a very overwhelming process.

Thank you is not enough :)",,Clear,"Onboarding team were meticulous, timely and extremely attentive during the onboarding process, resulting in a positive experience. Communication and dedication also contributed to the postivie experience.",,,,,
23,Application Review,Phreesia,"I have just finished onboarding with Phreesia. I have had the pleasure of having Mr. Shubhankar Singh. I have to say, adding Phreesia to Athena just rocked my world. It isn't really until you finish onboarding that you truly realize what you're getting for a small business, if you have one. Phreesia acts like the front and back bookends to Athena, with some extra stuff thrown in between. I look forward to a long and happy relationship.

26,Application Review,Phreesia,Our office implemented with Phreesia about 6 months ago. We had a wonderful implementation team. Phreesia was extremely diligent in making sure that we had all forms and processes the way our physicians requested. They continue to support us in any issue that arises. I would definitely recommend them. I wanted to give a special thank you to Karan.,,Clear,,,,,,
27,Application Review,Phreesia,"we really like the phreesia platform. The team is very attentive to our needs. They are very engaged and work to support our success. They feel like team members. We love our account rep Shubhit Mathus, he works hard to help us customize and tailor the workflows to our clinical operations. we use it for patient intake, check-in, copay collection, appointment reminders, online scheduling, eligibility checking, appointment accelerator, and are looking at other features - LOVE the way they are able to report progress/results and show their value to us",,,,,,,,

29,Application Review,Phreesia,"I have been using Phreesia since 2021. Phreesia has improved the efficiency and effectiveness of my practice by automating patient intake and engagement. I recently had the pleasure of working with Arpit Shah from Phreesia and the service he provides is nothing short of exceptional. Arpit is incredibly responsive and professional throughout our engagement. He is always available to answer questions and provides timely updates, ensuring that I am well-informed at every stage.",,,,,,,,
30,Application Review,Phreesia,"Phreesia has been a great addition to our office workflow. Our Phreesia implementation team has been great to work with. They are on weekly calls to troubleshoot and improve the process for our office, while accessible for daily questions via email. Overall, the patients are receptive. The office has implemented Phreesia easily. There are some favorite features of course. Phreesia has integrated nicely with Athena. Co-pays can be collected when the patient is registering, the patients can attach their Insurance card, and forms are editable. We have also added the tablet for in office registration, when needed. It has been a beneficial addition to our office.",,,,,,,,
31,Application Review,TSI - Profit Recovery,"TSI is a fantastic collection agency. Joseph Krolikowski has been a tremendous help with training our team on how to work our collections in TSI and how to research in athena. We have learned more from him about navigating athena than from athena's videos. If you need assistance with your collections and training your staff, you should reach out to him directly at joseph.krolikowski@transworldsystems.com.
",,,,,,,,
32,Application Review,TSI - Profit Recovery,Orthopaedic Associates implemented TSI Profit Recovery a year ago. The integration process was seamless and return on this investment has remained high. We strongly recommend this as an Athena user as super easy to implement and to use. It has definitely helped capture collections that might have otherwise been uncollected.,,,,,,,,
33,Application Review,TSI - Profit Recovery,"TSI has been wonderful to work with. Their collection rates for us have been impressive, the customer support has been responsive, and the platform is very easy to navigate. From the psychiatry perspective, our patients have been treated with sensitivity and respect. Our rep Mike Buske is always prompt and supportive.",,,,,,,,
34,Application Review,TSI - Profit Recovery,"TSI works so well with Athena and I have not had any issues. Mike, our account rep, is always available to help with any issues that we have. We are very pleased with the turn around of them collecting our money.",,,,,,,,
35,Application Review,TSI - Profit Recovery,"Very effective, professional and sensible. We would recommend to all practices in need of a collections agency. Thank you TSI and Bret!",,,,,,,,
36,Application Review,TSI - Profit Recovery,"TSI is not very flexible and their back end customer service has left a lot to be desired. Also, their collection fees that are charged to us are a lot higher than our local collection agencies.",,,,,,,,
37,Application Review,TSI - Profit Recovery,Betsy s. was so helpful getting us to better understand TSI's website. Betsy is a very nice and helpful person.,,,,,,,,
38,Application Review,TSI - Profit Recovery,TSI integrates seamlessly with Athena. The workflows are very easy to learn. TSI reporting is very clear on the results from the accounts we send them to work. definitely a great partner for Athena.,,,,,,,,
39,Application Review,TSI - Profit Recovery,"We have been using TSI since before I started with the company. I had been promoted and took over our collections process. I recently had a meeting with Karen Cooper and Joe Krolikowski who helped us with figuring out our collection policies in Athena and how to automate some processes to take some of the work load off of us. It was incredibly helpful and they both had great insights into the system and how to make it work FOR us. I can't say enough how much I appreciated them taking the time to walk us through all of the steps and answering all of our questions. I have nothing but good things to say about TSI, Karen, and Joe!",,,,,,,,
40,Application Review,TSI - Profit Recovery,TSI is awesome. Joe explained detail by detail on how to make the collections process very easy.,,,,,,,,
41,Application Review,TSI - Profit Recovery,"We enjoy the ease of use and direct integrations with Athena. However, their ""soft collections"" option is not effective. Around 90% of all people sent to soft collections ended up not paying and going to the next level which is a traditional collections model. Save yourself the money and only send to traditional collections. Also recently our connection between TSI and Athena has broken in that any account that is closed by TSI does not report that back to Athena at all. Leaving us with patients charts stating they still owe money when in fact they do not. TSI has looked into the problem but found that it must be on the Athena side and closed the case. Would like more collaboration between the TSI and Athena teams. Also last critical point is that the dashboard graphs are not correct at all making them useless, and also there is no way to filter out closed accounts on the account list page. TSI has a lot of potential to make things great with little effort but no quite there yet.",,,,,,,,
42,Application Review,TSI - Profit Recovery,"I have been on Athena since 2001. I have been with TSI, since 2011. TSI is so easy to use, and works seamlessly with Athena. I see excellent results and in a timely manner. The option of automating the self-pay collections, means a practice won’t get busy and forget to send over-due accounts to collections! I also can easily log into TSI’s portal and report payments, and when a patient pays TSI directly it is reported right into Athena!! I do not have to do anything! TSI provides a dedicated service representative for your account. Whenever I email or call my rep Charlie, he responds immediately. He also reaches out to me often with pleasant emails checking to see if I need anything. I would highly recommend TSI to any medical group. TSI offers excellent recovery of your money and great customer service. And, if your group uses Athena, using TSI is a no brainer. They take recovering your money seriously and work so well with Athena, you can just sit back and watch your money come in. Thank you for allowing me this opportunity to say how pleased I am with TSI",,,,,,,,
43,Application Review,TSI - Profit Recovery,"1.4.22 Wanted to let everyone know how much I appreciate the hard work and help I get from TSI on our accounts. Our rep. Jimmie Dukes is very knowledgeable and a very kind person. The whole team is great to work with. Thanks, VP",,,,,,,,
44,Application Review,TSI - Profit Recovery,"We are a very small practice that has been reluctant to engage with a collection agency since our start-up. We love our patients and hate to send any accounts to collections and with minimal staff already doing 3 jobs each, no one had the time to take on another task. However, it finally became unavoidably necessary. TSI was highly recommended so we initiated contact. Betsy Sendel responded promptly. Long story short - we should have done this a long time ago! Betsy is always quick to respond to any question or issue that arises. She was so attentive to our specific needs and flexible to accommodate our crazy schedule for the initial set-up. TSI pretty much does everything for you after you submit the accounts, which is so quick & easy through Athena. If you are hesitantly looking into a collection partner or are not happy with your current agency - jump on in here! You will find it warm and satisfying :-)",,,,,,,,
45,Application Review,TSI - Profit Recovery,I have worked with TSI for over 15 years. Rosemary and the Athena interface have made an exceptional improvement in our collection process and I personally appreciate their efficiency and processes.,,,,,,,,
